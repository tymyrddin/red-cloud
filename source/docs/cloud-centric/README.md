# Introduction

## What?

Some attacks, such as DoS, have specialised context when applied to the cloud. Other attacks focus on services 
available only within cloud environments, such as malware injection and side-channel attacks for cloud resources.

## Why?

To gain further access within a cloud environment or to use the cloud environment as an attack tool to accomplish 
goals against other Internet-facing targets.
