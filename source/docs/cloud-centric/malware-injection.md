# Malware injection

## Attack tree

```text
1 Injection
    1.1 XSS
    1.2 SQLi
    1.3 Using a service (SaaS or PaaS)
    1.4 Affecting served images (IaaS)
```

## Notes

* XSS and SQLi attacks also work in the cloud. And there are additional vectors of
attack for malware injection in the cloud. Attackers may be able to use the
access acquired through other attacks to inject malicious content into served images or
cloud services.
* Good controls for integrity management are less often considered
