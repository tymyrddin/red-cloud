# Introduction

## What?

Continuously identifying all the possible vulnerabilities whenever a change happens in any 
of the systems included in the scope of an assessment. 

## Why?

While repeated penetration testing is likely to only occasionally report vulnerabilities of a narrow scope
of assets (at cost, including loss of productivity and service disruption), a vulnerability assessment will enable
systematic identification of vulnerabilities that might appear in the whole inventory of databases on an ongoing,
proactive basis. This way, vulnerabilities can be remediated before the asset can even expose itself to any threats.
