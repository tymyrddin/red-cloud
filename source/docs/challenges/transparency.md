# Lack of transparency

Not-so-well-known cloud services often use third party data centers. Users may not know where the data is stored 
and what hardware or software configuration is used. Such a lack of transparency exposes data to security risks. The 
cloud service provider may even be gathering and selling sensitive data without the knowledge of the user. 

Well-known cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. usually conduct in-house security audits, but these 
resources cannot be audited by a security auditor the client or user chooses. Nor can clients or users respond if 
those underlying resources are hacked. This has to be reported, and the CSP will get to it (hopefully).
