# Resource sharing

Cloud services share resources across multiple accounts. This resource sharing can prove problematic, and not only 
during cloud penetration testing. 

Some service providers do not even use proper segmentation of the users. 

If an organisation has a compliancy requirement which states that all the other accounts sharing the resource and 
the cloud service provider should be PCI DSS compliant too, this can lead to complex cloud infrastructure 
implementations. 

And such complex scenarios can make cloud penetration testing hard to do.
