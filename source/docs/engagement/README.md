# Introduction

## What?

Inject carefully chosen special characters into forms and fields here and 
there until we trigger an anomaly, like an explicit database error, a 404 
(Page Not Found) error, or an unexpected redirection to the main page.

## Why?

A steady approach: go through each website, follow each link, inspect every parameter, and gather hidden links in 
JavaScript files.

## How?
