# Password spraying

## Attack tree

```text
1 Take a large number of usernames and loop them with a single password
```

## Notes

In many cases, multifactor authentication will be in place and will mitigate these attacks, and in case vulnerable 
cloud interfaces are exposed, password spraying tools designed for common login services may not work. Use 
cloudspecific tools for password spraying.
