# Introduction

## What?

Hacking CI/CD pipelines, a set of practices put in place to enable development teams to make changes, test code, and deploy more reliably.

* CI: Continuous Integration is the process in which software source code is kept in a central repository (such as GitHub). 
* CD: Continuous Delivery is the following step of the continuous integration model where code is automatically deployed to the test, pre-production, or production environments. 

## Why?

* Access to resources
* Access to the source code repository to include a payload in the codebase and in the deployed application
* Complete compromise of the infrastructure

## How?

Use weaknesses in setup and configurations, such as:

* Access security
* User permissions
* Keys and secrets
* User security
* Default configurations
