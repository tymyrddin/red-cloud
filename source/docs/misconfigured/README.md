# Introduction

## What?

Misconfiguration is a big reason why systems are exploited in on-premises environments and with cloud resources.

## Why?

Whether it is Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS), securing cloud asset configurations can be simple or very complex. 
The more sophisticated the platform, the more difficult it may be to secure the platform, and when moving into 
PaaS or IaaS, complexities can be huge, and mistakes are made more easily. The bigger the energy-saving promise, the 
bigger the entropy.

* [Federation](federation.md)
* [Object storage](object-storage.md)
