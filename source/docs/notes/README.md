# Introduction

## What?

Notes on techniques used for: 

* Leveraging cloud vulnerabilities identified to successfully penetrate security controls, using mostly manual attacks with only some semi-automated support.
* Gaining access to cloud application data and/or permissions (access) not previously available.

Note: Exploitation of web services may not be possible given the security controls present, the complexity of the attack (undocumented, or not enough documentation/context), and the time allotment for testing.

## Why?

To overcome the challenges to build a meaningful and sustainable cloud testing practice.
