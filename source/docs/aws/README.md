# Introduction

## What?

Hands on access with common misconfigurations across AWS environments and understanding defensive mitigations to prevent these attacks:

* Identifying, enumerating and exploiting overly permissive IAM users, roles and policies
* Exploring serverless infrastructure and common attack vectors present within these services
* Exploiting weaknesses in the most common AWS services including S3, EC2, VPC, etc.

## Why?

In this era of cloud computing, from individuals, enterprises to large conglomerates, everyone is migrating towards the cloud. With this come often unseen threats because Cloud environments are different from the traditional infrastructure.

With millions of active customers, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most popular cloud service providers, and due to the same reason, it is of prime importance to hackers. Gaining access to one such corporate AWS account can cost a company billions of dollars.
