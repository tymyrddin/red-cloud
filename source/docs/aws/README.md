# Introduction

## What?

Hands on access with common misconfigurations across AWS environments and understanding defensive mitigations to prevent these attacks:

* Identifying, enumerating and exploiting overly permissive IAM users, roles and policies
* Exploring serverless infrastructure and common attack vectors present within these services
* Exploiting weaknesses in the most common AWS services including S3, EC2, VPC, etc.

## Why?

Amazon Web Services is the most popular cloud service provider in the world offering hundreds of services.
